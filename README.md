This repository contains the code, machine learning models, and datasets used in the paper "A Survey of Classical and Quantum Sequence Models"

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of different kinds of classical and quantum sequence models. We survey different sequence
models with special focus on quantum self attention nueral networks and quantum recurrent nueral networks. We also implement and analyse 
the results of the following :
+ Quantum Self Attention Nueral Networks (QSANN)
+ Quantum Vision Transformer (QVT)
+ Classical Transformer
+ Quantum Recurrent Nueral Networks
+ Classical Recurrent Nueral Networks
